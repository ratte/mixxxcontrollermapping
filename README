cleanup and additions to the work of mich@softwareschneiderei.ch



Description of Mappings
===============

Hot Cue
=======
(click MODE -> off = Cue Mode)
1,2 : Select/Store Hotcue 1,2
3,4 : Delete Hotcue 1,2

Loop
=====
1,2 loop in / out
3: halve looping time
4: looping off

Headpone Plus/Minus Buttons:
==================
Buttons are not mapped. The Controller takes care of adjusting the volume 
of the controllers headphone plug. Mixxx also adjustes the volume independend 
of the controller.

Pitch
====
To have a more precide way to work, Pitching makes fine tuning, Plus/Minus Buttons are temporary 
pitchings. 
Pressing Plus- and Minus-Buttons together resets the Pitch to Zero.
(Feel free to change  :)



Todo:
=====

7) Headphone +- Switches -> Headphone-Volume
8) Effects
9) Better Looping Mappings
10) Simulate Gain with Vinyl + Pitch
11) Simulate Mastervolume with Headphone-+ & Vinyl
12) Image for Documentation of Mappings / Wiki

Done:
=====
1) Automapping
2) Jog Wheels
3) Pitch +/- & PitchSwitch
4) Pitch - and + simultaneously = Reset Pitch to Zero
5) Hotcue Deletions
